/* Beta 1.0 — localStorage runs out, and saveLocal() takes the caller down with it.

   REPORTED (item 1, with a screenshot of the sign-in popup):
     "Failed to execute 'setItem' on 'Storage': Setting the value of
      'imode_test_v532_line_requests' exceeded the quota."

   Reproduced against the live project, and it is not cosmetic. saveLocal() — the copy in
   js/04, which overrides js/03's and writes SIXTEEN keys in a row with no try/catch — throws
   out of whatever called it:

     * signing in:   setSessionUser() -> applySession() -> the error lands in the login popup
                     and the session is never completed. That is the screenshot.
     * every page:   ensureMasters() saves on every renderAll(), so goPage() threw half way
                     through and the page it was building was left empty. That is REPORTED
                     ITEM 5 — the ตั้งค่า -> "หน้าลูกค้า · สแกน QR" button landing on a blank
                     page. The same bug, not a second one; measured, not assumed.
     * silently:     the throw lands on the 11th of 16 setItem calls, so serviceReports,
                     qcRecords, pettyCash, spareParts and purchaseOrders were simply never
                     written after that point.

   WHAT IS ACTUALLY FULL, measured on a synced device (Chrome allows about 5 MB):

     imode_test_v532_cases          3,580,444   of which 3,546,857 is `media`
     imode_test_v532_line_requests  1,711,385   of which 1,699,682 is `media`
     everything else together         ~234,000

   So 97% of it is the photos and clips customers attach to แจ้งปัญหา. Since part 18 those
   travel to Supabase (`service_cases.media`, `line_customer_requests.media`), so the copy in
   localStorage is a cache of something the server already holds.

   WHAT THIS FILE DOES

     1. saveLocal() never throws again. A quota failure is caught, weight is shed, and the
        save is retried. If even that cannot fit, it reports and returns — the in-memory data
        is still correct and the cloud push is a separate path, so a full device must not be
        allowed to break sign-in, navigation, or anything else.

     2. Weight is shed by writing the two heavy arrays to storage with their `media` replaced
        by a stub that keeps the file's name, type and size but drops the data URL. THE
        IN-MEMORY ARRAYS ARE NOT TOUCHED. That matters: js/42 injects `media` into the
        outgoing payload from the case object, so mutating it would upload stubs over good
        cloud rows, and js/71 re-uploads rows the cloud has not acknowledged. Only the bytes
        on their way to localStorage are lighter. The swap is made around the base call and
        undone in a `finally` — JavaScript is single threaded and the base is synchronous, so
        nothing else can observe it. Same technique as js/63's checklistTemplate swap.

     3. A row the cloud has NOT acknowledged keeps its media whatever happens. Those are the
        rows whose photos exist nowhere else yet; js/71 knows which they are from
        `imode_v70_cloud_seen`, and that list is read here rather than duplicated.

     4. Newest first, up to a byte budget; everything else stubbed. A technician looking at
        today's job still sees the photos offline; a case from three weeks ago re-fetches
        them on the next sync.

   Shed mode, once entered, is remembered in `imode_v70_storage_shed` so the next page load
   starts light instead of throwing once more before learning the same thing. Clearing that
   key only costs one caught exception.

   Nothing is deleted and no storage key is renamed. Remove this file and the old behaviour —
   including the crash — returns exactly. */

 /* WHICH ROWS THE SERVER ALREADY HAS. Two signals, because neither is enough on its own.

    (a) js/71's `imode_v70_cloud_seen`. Authoritative when it is populated — but its
        reconcile() returns early for a table whose pre-sync array was empty, so on a device
        that has never held data (a fresh install, a cleared browser — and every first run,
        which is exactly when the attachments arrive in bulk) the list for `cases` is never
        written at all. Relying on it alone left every row looking unacknowledged and shed
        nothing; measured.

    (b) what came down in a sync during THIS page view. syncCloud() replaces `cases` and
        `lineRequests` wholesale from the cloud, so every id present once it has finished came
        from the server — and so did its media, because js/42 puts the column on the same
        upsert. The one exception is a row js/71 rescued, and js/71 re-uploads those
        immediately, so they become true within moments.

    A row in neither is treated as the only copy of its photos and is never stubbed. */
