/* I-MODE Plus Service & Maintenance — offline service worker.
   Beta 1.0 — 2026-09-23. Written so a technician who is on site with no signal can still OPEN
   the app, not merely keep a tab alive.

   WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. Everything except the data is fetched from the server on every load:
   index.html, 23 stylesheets, 110 scripts, the four auth files and the customer page fragment.
   An open tab kept working offline, but a reload, a new tab, or a phone that evicted the tab
   got a blank screen. js/03 used to register a service worker here and there has never been a
   file at this path, so it 404'd on every boot until part 28 removed the line.

   THE STRATEGY, and why it is not the fast one.

     same-origin  ->  NETWORK FIRST, cache only as the fallback
     ./assets/ ./vendor/  ->  cache first (they do not change, and they are the big ones)
     cross-origin ->  network, then cache, then a harmless empty response
     supabase.co  ->  never touched: always the network, never cached

   Cache-first for scripts would be faster, and it is the wrong trade HERE. This application is
   patch-over-patch: js/NN files override each other in numeric order and a page running some
   files from a previous deploy and some from the current one is not a slower app, it is a
   BROKEN one — an override applied to a function that has changed underneath it. Network-first
   means an online device always runs one consistent set, and the cache exists for exactly the
   case it was built for: there is no network at all.

   A stale Supabase response would be worse than no response, so anything addressed to
   supabase.co is passed straight through and never stored.

   THE PRECACHE LIST IS NOT IN THIS FILE, deliberately. A hard-coded list of 146 paths in a
   project that adds a script almost every session is a list that is wrong within a week, and
   the symptom would be a file that works online and is missing offline — the worst kind,
   because testing online never shows it. Instead js/111 reads what the document ACTUALLY
   loaded (`link[rel=stylesheet]`, `script[src]`) and posts it here after `load`. It cannot
   drift, because it is not a copy of anything.

   TO FORCE EVERY DEVICE TO REBUILD ITS CACHE: bump VERSION. Old caches are deleted on
   activate. To remove this entirely: `imodeDisableOffline()` in the console, or delete the
   registration in js/111 — nothing else depends on it. */

var VERSION = 'v2-2026-09-24';

/* The handful the document never references, so js/111 cannot discover them: the customer
   page is read by XHR, the QR decoder is loaded lazily on the first scan, and the case
   workspace is a separate document reached by navigation.

   The two document logos are here because js/111 collects script[src] and link[href] and
   NOT img[src] — deliberately, so a page full of machine photographs is not dragged into
   the cache. These two are chrome rather than content: the first is the customer page's
   own header logo (pages/customer-home.html and js/14) and the second dresses every
   printed document, QR sheet and QC form. Without them a customer opening their page on a
   phone with no signal gets the layout with a broken image where the logo belongs. */
