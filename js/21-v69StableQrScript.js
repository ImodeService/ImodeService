/* V6.9 — a machine QR that works on somebody else's phone.

   Reported from the real site: scanning a printed QR on a phone showed
   "ไม่พบข้อมูลเครื่องจาก QR Code".

   The cause is in ensureMasters() (js/03):

       machines.forEach(m=>{ if(!m.qrToken) m.qrToken='QR-'+uid()... })

   uid() is random, and there is no shared database yet, so every browser that opens the
   site invents its **own** token for the same machine. A QR printed from the office PC
   carried that PC's token; the customer's phone seeded its own machines with different
   tokens and matched nothing. Machine ids and serials, by contrast, come from
   js/02-demo-data.js and are identical everywhere — which is why typing the serial worked
   and scanning did not.

   So the token is now derived from the machine id: QR-<machine id>. Two devices compute
   the same value for the same machine without talking to each other, and the QR travels.

   Note for whoever reprints labels: a QR generated before this change carries a random
   token that no longer resolves. Reprint them. (No QR had ever worked on a second device,
   so nothing that used to work stops working.)

   The real fix for machines the office ADDS later is Supabase — a machine created on the
   office PC does not exist on the customer's phone at all, whatever its token. See
   supabase/README.md. */

    the one that asks for a QR scan or a serial — and there was no URL for it at all.
